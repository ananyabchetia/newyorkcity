## Whatâ€™s Up With That! 
My data looked at the number of employed disabled people in the city. I found that most counties are close to having less than 1 percent chance of having a disability. The outlier here was New York County. The outlier is also (GEOID: 36061001402) and it is located in Manhattan, New York County in New York. This tract covers the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, including Rutgers Slip and is part of the 10002 ZIP code.
This outlier now shows that this area had an over 7 percent population where the employed were also disabled.
